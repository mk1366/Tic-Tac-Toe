Tic-Tac-Toe:

A simple game that allows user to create an account and play multiple rounds of the tic-tac-toe.

Technologies Used:

•	JavaScript
•	HTML5
•	AJAX
•	JQUERY
•	Bootstrap
•	SASS

Planning and Development process:

•	As a process of my game development, I first draw a wireframe to layout the structure, and content of the game which include sign-up, sign-in, change-password and game-board.
•	Separate, the html, CSS, and JavaScript in different files and then link them properly.

•	Built the user authentication for sign-up, sign-in and change-password.

•	Using the API: https://tic-tac-toe-wdi.herokuapp.com/' asynchronous (AJAX) call, JavaScript, and jQuery for event handling.

•	The game has been tested on web browser chrome and Safari but has not being tested on other devices. When the user wins, loses or gets a tie it sends parameters through AJAX so that the app hosting its web view can determine how the player did.

Unsolved Problems
•	Add functionality that will allow the user to store the scores.
•	 Implement additional CSS to make the game layout attractive
•	Add sound effect
