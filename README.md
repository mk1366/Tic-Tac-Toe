# Tic-Tac-Toe:

A simple game that allows user to create an account and play multiple rounds of the tic-tac-toe.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- Ajax
- General Assembly Tic-Tac-Toe API
- CURL for API testing

## Planning and Development process:

  - As a process of my game development, I first draw a wireframe to layout the structure, and content of the game which include sign-up, sign-in, change-password and game-board. Problem solving strategies involved were first creating a plan on paper, then translating it into psuedocode, and finally coded the solution
  - Separate, the html, CSS, and JavaScript in different files and then link them properly.
  - Built the user authentication for sign-up, sign-in and change-password.
  - Using the API: https://tic-tac-toe-wdi.herokuapp.com/' asynchronous (AJAX) call, JavaScript, and jQuery for event handling.
  - The game has been tested on web browser chrome and Safari but has not being tested on other devices. When the user wins, loses or gets a tie it sends parameters through AJAX so that the app hosting its web view can determine how the player did.

I used Google and my class notes to help with the project.
